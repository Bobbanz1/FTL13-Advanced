SHIP SALVAGE TEMPLATES

These are the templates spawned in when a ship is destroyed

The idea is that the destroyed ship objects as a result don't look blocky, while they have the proper destruction defined in the ship datums.

Use the areas corresponding to coordinates in the ship datums for the areas of the ship (/area/ship_salvage/component/c_2_1) and hull areas for walls/windows (/area/ship_salvage/hull)

For an example, use skirmisher.dmm
